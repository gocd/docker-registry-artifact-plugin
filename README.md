## About the license and releasing your plugin under a different license

The skeleton code in this repository is licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. The license itself specifies the terms
under which derivative works may be distributed (the license also defines derivative works). The Apache 2.0 license is a
permissive open source license that has minimal requirements for downstream licensors/licensees to comply with.

This does not prevent your plugin from being licensed under a different license as long as you comply with the relevant
clauses of the Apache 2.0 license (especially section 4). Typically, you clone this repository and keep the existing
copyright notices. You are free to add your own license and copyright notice to any modifications.

This is not legal advice. Please contact your lawyers if needed.
